= How to set up `spring-data-aerospike` in Spring Boot application
:toc:

:spring-boot-version: 3.3.0
:spring-data-aerospike-version: 4.8.0

== Setting up the project

In this section we'll cover setup of the project from the start.

First, we'll need to set up the basic project structure.
You can do it either manually if you are familiar with the process or do it via https://start.spring.io/[Spring Initializr].

In Spring Initializr you'll need to select:

- Project: https://stackoverflow.com/a/13335439/688926[Maven] project
- Language: Java
- https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot[Spring Boot]: {spring-boot-version}
- Java: 17

.Options to select

Press Generate button in the bottom of the page, and you'll get zip with initial project. Import project into your
favorite IDE and run the test. It should be green and that means that you are ready to continue to the next section.

== Adding `spring-data-aerospike` dependency

[NOTE]
====
`spring-data-aerospike` is a Community project and the dependency is not managed by Spring, it has its own release cycle
and is not included into Spring Boot dependency management. Available versions can be checked on
https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.aerospike/spring-data-aerospike[Maven Central].

https://github.com/aerospike-community/spring-data-aerospike#spring-boot-compatibility[Spring Boot compatibility] can be
checked for the version of `spring-data-aerospike` that is compatible with the specific Spring Boot version.
====

In our case we are going to use `spring-data-aerospike` {spring-data-aerospike-version} as we have Spring Boot {spring-boot-version}:

.pom.xml
[source,xml]
----
include::../pom.xml[tags=spring-data-aerospike]
----


== Creating Aerospike repository

We will be using https://projectlombok.org/[Lombok] library to omit the boilerplate code in the entity class.
Add `lombok` into your `pom.xml`:

.pom.xml
[source,xml]
----
include::../pom.xml[tags=lombok]
----

We are going to use the movies domain in this project, so to be able to read and save our movies into Aerospike we will need to create:

. document(entity) class that represents our domain model,
. repository class that provides https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRUD[CRUD] operations.

Movie document class will look the following way:


.MovieDocument.java
[source,java]
----
include::../src/main/java/com/example/demo/persistence/simplecrud/MovieDocument.java[]
----

Document explained:

<1> https://projectlombok.org/features/Value[`@Value`] makes class immutable, all fields are made private and final,
`toString()`, `equals()`, `hashCode()`, field getters and all args constructor are generated.

<2> `@Document(collection = "demo-service-movies")` marks a class as an entity to be persisted to Aerospike. It also allows to specify set name, expiration and touch on read values. In current example custom set name is specified via `collection`. Please note that a set name cannot contain the ':' or ';' characters. (See more https://www.aerospike.com/docs/guide/limitations.html[limitations])

<3> `@Builder` provide Builder API for a class.

<4> `@AllArgsConstructor` creates public all-args constructor for a class (which is hidden by `@Builder`).
Spring Data can use all-args constructor instead of reflection to https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/data-commons/docs/current/reference/html/#mapping.object-creation[gain performance boost] for object creation.

<5> `@Id` marks a field as the primary key.

<6> `@Field` is optional, can be set just for the clarity purpose.

<7> `@Field("desc")` configures the name of a field to be used when persisting the document. This value will be used as a bin name instead of the original field name.

<8> `@Indexed` creates https://www.aerospike.com/docs/architecture/secondary-index.html[secondary index] on application startup for the specific field. Note: `@Indexed` annotation is not supported for the fields annotated with `@Id`, `@Expiration` or `@Version` annotations.

<9> `@Version` enables https://stackoverflow.com/questions/129329/optimistic-vs-pessimistic-locking[optimistic locking], so that concurrent updates are not lost when saving an entity. Note that if concurrent update fails -- `OptimisticLockingFailureException` is thrown.

[NOTE]
====
Aerospike has https://www.aerospike.com/docs/guide/limitations.html[limitation] on the bin name length.
If your document contains field with name that exceeds this limit, specify short name in `@Field` annotation:
----
    @Field("shortName")
    String veryLoooongFieldName;
----
====

Create Movie Repository interface:

.MovieRepository.java
[source,java]
----
include::../src/main/java/com/example/demo/persistence/simplecrud/MovieRepository.java[]
----

Repository explained:

<1> `CrudRepository` provides sophisticated CRUD functionality for the entity class.

== Configuring connection to Aerospike

//TODO: autoconfiguration coming soon. Add link to repo

To configure connection to Aerospike you'll need to create configuration class that extends `AbstractAerospikeDataConfiguration`.
Basic setup requires `getHosts()` and `namespace()` methods to be implemented,
but you can also override e.g. `getClientPolicy()` to specify custom configuration for the Aerospike client,
or `customConverters()` to add custom converters.

We are going to use
https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/spring-boot-features.html#boot-features-external-config-typesafe-configuration-properties[`@ConfigurationProperties`]
for binding Aerospike configuration properties to POJO. Since connection parameters are required, configuration needs to be validated.
To enable validation add `hibernate-validator` dependency to `pom.xml` or `spring-boot-starter-validation`:

.pom.xml
[source,xml]
----
include::../pom.xml[tags=hibernate-validator]
----

Simple configuration will look the following way:

.AerospikeConfiguration.java
[source,java]
----
include::../src/main/java/com/example/demo/persistence/configuration/AerospikeConfiguration.java[]
----

== Testing

To verify that the repository is actually working let's add some basic tests:

.MovieRepositoryTests.java
[source,java]
----
include::../src/test/java/com/example/demo/MovieRepositoryTests.java[]
----

For the test purposes you can use https://github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-spring-boot[`embedded-aerospike`] library based on https://github.com/testcontainers[`testcontainers`].

NOTE: `spring-cloud-starter-bootstrap` is required to be present on classpath. If you are not using Spring Cloud you can add `spring-cloud-starter-bootstrap` with `test` scope.

.pom.xml
[source,xml]
----
include::../pom.xml[tags=test-deps]
----

This will set up Aerospike container when the test starts.

Add Aerospike configuration to the test resources:

./test/resources/application.properties
----
aerospike.hosts=${embedded.aerospike.host}:${embedded.aerospike.port}
aerospike.namespace=${embedded.aerospike.namespace}
----

and run the test. It will be green now.
